## Credit Card Fraud Detection
 
  - One major challenge credit card companies face year after year is to identify fraudulent transactions.

Many controls have been implemented to address this issue. However, most solutions add additional burdens to the customers.

We decided to address this complex problem by implementing machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions based on usersâ€™ behavior.
